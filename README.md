# Personal Neovim configuration
This repo is going to track my personal Neovim configuration over time.

I just started the Neovim journey and I'm constantly learning.\
Feel free to reach out if you want to share opinions, tips and tricks.

The Neovim learning journey never ends. Let's see where it brings us!
